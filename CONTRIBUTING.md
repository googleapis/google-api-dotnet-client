## Contributor License Agreements

Before we can accept your pull requests you'll need to sign a Contributor

- **If you are an individual writing original source code** and **you own the intellectual property**,
then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA][individual-cla].
- **If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work**,
then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][corporate-cla].

You can sign these electronically (just scroll to the bottom). After that,

# Code Layout

These libraries are split into:

- [Generated client libraries][client-libs]: The per-service libraries as used by users. The source code for these is generated by the Client Generator
- [Client Generator][client-gen]: The code generator for the above.
- [Support Libraries][support-libs]: Support code for the client libraries.

[support-libs]: https://github.com/google/google-api-dotnet-client/tree/master/Src/Support
[client-libs]: https://github.com/google/google-api-dotnet-client/tree/master/Src/Generated
[client-gen]: https://github.com/google/google-api-dotnet-client/tree/master/ClientGenerator

## Building and .NET Core

We use Visual Studio 2015 to edit the Support Libraries.

[MSBuild][msbuild] is currently used to run the Client Generator, and to build both the generated Client Libraries and the Support Libraries.

We are gradually transitioning towards using [dotnet cli][dotnetcli] for testing and building (see [#822][822]). Until this is complete there are both `csproj` and `project.json` projects for all support libraries.

[msbuild]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0k6kkbsd.aspx
[dotnetcli]: https://github.com/dotnet/cli
[822]: https://github.com/google/google-api-dotnet-client/issues/822

## Tests

Support Library tests use [NUnit][nunit].

Tests for the `.NET45` platform are run using [run`_`tests.bat][runtests], or can be run directly from within Visual Studio.
Tests for `.NET Core` are run using [run`_`tests`_`dotnetcore.bat][runtestscorebat] (Windows) or [run`_`tests`_`dotnetcore.sh][runtestscoresh] (Linux).
