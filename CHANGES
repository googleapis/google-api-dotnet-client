Change Summary

1.3

2013-03-14
* Update to Python 2.7
* rename templates from 'stable' to explicitly versioned
* Many changes to the Java surface in preparation for the 1.14 series
* Allow comments in the json configuration files
* Allow expansion of variables in the features.json files
* Improved code coverage
* Fixes to parent lineage in parsed API structure
* Fixed the time stamp and copyright blocks so they can be easily disabled
  (for doing side-by-side testing)
* Allow alternate generated package names via new discovery fields.
* Renamed uses of 'package' meaning "a unit of code in a programming' language
  to the term 'module'. All CodeObjects now belong to a module.
* Better type specifications for array and map types.
* Sort resources, methods and parameters so that we do not get random different
  in emitted code in each run.
* Preliminary support for yet another Dart style

1.2.0

2012-08-29
* Roll up of dozens of changes to the generator structure.
* Addition of a rough Dart binding.
* Many changes to the Java surface to reflect new features.


1.1.1

2011-10-20
* add DataType classes to replace the use of strings for types.
  - Completely rework the interpretation of JsonSchema into DataTypes to
    make them clearer.
* A large set of refactorings in an ongoing effort to make Api definitions
  distinct from the language we will generate in
  - add LanguageModel, which each language subclasses to provide utililes
    for formatting DataTypes for use in templates
  - defer creation of codeType from API parsing to code generation, using
    the pair of LanguageModel and DataType to emit the right thing.
* Add Packages to the things which can appear in code. Use package.name in
  templates rather than explictly building relative paths.
* Add a parent/child relationship between data models. This is to pave the
  way for generators which represent anonymous classes as nested classes.
* Add tags for building parameter lists. This moved the code to create those
  lists from Annotators buried in the per-language generators out to templates.
* Add a 'call_template' tag to make it factor out common template idioms.
