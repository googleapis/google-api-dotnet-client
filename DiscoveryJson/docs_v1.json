Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern\n`\u003cprefix\u003e%[nesting_level]\u003csuffix\u003e`. Note that the prefix and suffix are\noptional and can be arbitrary strings.\n\nFor example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will\nreplace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0\nfollowed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of\nUPPER_ALPHA and\nglyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered\nglyphs\n\u003cp\u003e`A.`\n\u003cp\u003e`B.`\n\u003cp\u003e`C.`\n\nThe glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as\nwell as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a\nlist can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a\nglyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels\nhave DECIMAL glyph\ntypes, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs\n\u003cp\u003e`1.`\n\u003cp\u003e`2.`\n\u003cp\u003e`  2.1.`\n\u003cp\u003e`  2.2.`\n\u003cp\u003e`3.`\n\nFor nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder\nin the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph's\norder within the list."
